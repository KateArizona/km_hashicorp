## What is the difference between push, pull, and fetch?

- `git push` - sent changes from a local branch to a remote repo
- `git fetch` - get changes from a remote repo into your tracking branch
- `git pull` - will get changes from a remote branch into your tracking branch and merge them into a local branch
